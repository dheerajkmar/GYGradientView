# Installation

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding GYGradientView as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

**Swift 4:**

```sh
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yhondri/GYGradientView", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

**Manually:**

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate Alamofire into your project manually.

Add GYGradientView.swift to your project And that's it!
